				The Road Not Taken
			</title>
			<text>
				Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth?Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear?Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back.I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I?I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.

				Oda a la papa
			</title>
			<text>
				Papa te llamas papa y no patata, no naciste castellana: eres oscura como nuestra piel, somos americanos, papa, somos indios. Profunda y suave eres, pulpa pura, purisima rosa blanca enterrada, floreces alla adentro en la tierra, en tu lluviosa tierra originaria, en las islas mojadas de Chile tempestuoso, en Chiloe marino, en medio de la esmeralda que abre su luz verde sobre el austral oceano.

				The Pool Players. Seven at the Golden Shovel. We real cool. We Left school. We Lurk late. We Strike straight. We Sing sin. We Thin gin. We Jazz June. We Die soon.

				The Tyger
			</title>
			<text>
				Tyger Tyger, burning bright, In the forests of the night? What immortal hand or eye, Could frame thy fearful symmetry? In what distant deeps or skies. Burnt the fire of thine eyes? On what wings dare he aspire? What the hand, dare seize the fire? And what shoulder, and what art, Could twist the sinews of thy heart? And when thy heart began to beat, What dread hand? and what dread feet? What the hammer? what the chain, In what furnace was thy brain? What the anvil? what dread grasp, Dare its deadly terrors clasp! When the stars threw down their spears And water?d heaven with their tears: Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee? Tyger Tyger burning bright, In the forests of the night: What immortal hand or eye, Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

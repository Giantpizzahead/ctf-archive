Apparently when using CTR, each character is encrypted sort of separately. So, you can just brute-force the flag's share code (64 * 64 possibilities since it's in Base64). Not that bad... just have to write the code.

Actually, by trying a very similar file name (replacing the _ with a ^, one below underscore on ASCII table), you can make the share codes so similar that brute forcing by hand will work. So, that's what I'm doing! :)

_ is up 4
_ is up 4 again
_ is down 8

So basically keep restarting until you get lucky. Try down and up 4.

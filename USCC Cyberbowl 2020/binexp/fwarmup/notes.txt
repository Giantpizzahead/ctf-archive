Flag is at 0x804a060

Need to follow pointer at 0xffffd060

Start at 0xffffcf70

Each one progresses 4 bytes, starts at 0xffffcf70, however, each %d moves back 2 bytes

Starts from 0xffffc74 (printing values)

240 -> 120 %ds followed by one %s

3 before reaching the same place, then 4 every time

4 and 4 - 5 and 8

%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%s..<address>

Google CTF 2019 (Beginner's Quest)

Enter Space-Time Coordinates (misc) - CTF{welcome_to_googlectf}
Open the executable file in Notepad.

Satellite (networking) - CTF{4efcc72090af28fd33a2118985541f92e793477f}
Run the program, use "Osmium" as the satellite name. Go to the Google Document from the config printout, and use a base64
decoder to get a hint to use Wireshark. With Wireshark running, view the config again to find the unblocked password (which
is the flag).

Work Computer (sandbox) - CTF{4ll_D474_5h4ll_B3_Fr33}
Explore a bit (especially in the /bin directory), using --help to get more info about programs. You'll find "makemime", which
can be used to get the contents of files in base64 format.

Flag 1 - CTF{Peace_from_Cauli!}
The program appears to find palindromic primes, and then XORs those with the constant numbers found in the program. I don't
know what the 1, 99, and 765 are for, so I guess we'll have to find out!
Actually, that value signifies which prime to start at. So, start at the K'th prime, and continue from there.
Use an online program (integer sequence A002385) to generate these palindromic primes, and decode the message.

For loop i from 0 to 722 (inclusive) - Just puts the original character in encoded.bmp

Flag is exactly 50 characters long

For loop i from 0 to 99 (inclusive)

If i is odd:
	Just put the original character in encoded.bmp
If i is even:
	For loop j from 0 to 7 (inclusive)
		Call codecChar(j, flag_chr[i/2])
		Put character resulting from call into encoded.bmp
      
         edi  esi
codedChar(j, flagc)
Returns the original character, with the LSB edited to match the encoded character in little endian order

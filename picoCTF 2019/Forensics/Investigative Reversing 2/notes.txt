var_60 = 2000

for loop from 0 to 2000 (inclusive)
just moves original.bmp into encoded.bmp, no changes

for loop j from 0 to 49 (inclusive) -> Characters of the flag
for loop k from 0 to 7 (inclusive) -> Bytes of encoded.bmp
Subtract 5 from character
Calls codedChar(var_k, char) (edi, esi)
Puts result byte into encoded.bmp

codedChar:
edx contains original, non shifted char
edi contains subtracted by 5 shifted char
codedChar retains only 1 bit of the encrypted char
k = 0 -> last bit, k = 1 -> 2nd last, etc.
It then masks the original character to remove the last bit, then replaces it with the calculated 1 bit.
So, it returns the original byte, but with the LSB either 0 or 1 depending on the value
